# Connect 4

This repo was created to solve MoureDev monthly challenges. Learn more at: [Monthly App Challenge 2022](https://github.com/mouredev/Monthly-App-Challenge-2022)

## Challenge Requirements

- 7x6 Board (7 in the "x" axis and 7 in the "y" axis).
- Red and yellow tokens. The first game starts with red token (the second one with yellow, the third with the red...).
- There's no need to implement a functionality to play against the App. We assume that two people will play with each other.
- At column selection the token will be put at the bottom.
- Save the number of games won for each player while the App is running.
- Two buttons to restart the match and reset the counter.
- You can add every extra functionality considered.

## Specs

- Made with UIKit and Storyboards
- Unit Tests where placed to ensure that the game works correctly
- Supports Dark Mode
- No third party libraries
